This version of appbundler is taken from https://bitbucket.org/infinitekind/appbundler (rev. dcd72b3). This project fixes a number of issues with the original appbundler, https://java.net/projects/appbundler.

Infinitekind only provides source code for appbundler, no releases, so the eXist-db project has to create its own build.

The current binary `lib/appbuilder-20181006.jar` was built by Joe Wicentowski on Oct. 6, 2018 using rev. dcd72b3, Oracle JDK 1.8.0_181-b13, and xcrun version 43 on macOS 10.14. (The xcrun tool and all that is needed to compile appbuilder is included the Xcode Command Line Tools, which can be installed via `xcode-select --install`; a full installation of Xcode is not necessary.)
